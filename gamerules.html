        <p>You're Santa Claus! Just as you're about to go and hand out your precious presents, you realise that someone has impersonated you to hand out booby-trapped gifts. To get ahead of you, the impostor has hidden your presents. To delay him, you do the same and try to collect your cargo before he does. Hurry up or you will miss him !</p>

        <p>Defeating the impostor couldn't be easier!  <br>
        We grabed the shovel for you and buried your precious gifts underground according to the following guidelines:  <br>
        - Place one gift of length 5, one of length 4, two of length 3 and one of length 2  <br>
        - Gifts must not touch each other on the sides and must not overlap  <br>
        - Gifts must be in rows or columns (not diagonally)  <br>
        Now, you'll need to dig up your opponent's gifts as quickly as possible.  <br>
        To do this, you'll have to take it in turns to dig up a square in your opponent's grid.  <br>
        When you've hit a gift, you will se it revealed, and when you've completely dug it up, you will se it with indicators. However, if you miss, you will only have dug up a hole in the snow.  <br>
        You win the game when you've destroyed all the presents your opponent has hidden to spoil Christmas! You will need to hurry up to hand out all your presents.
